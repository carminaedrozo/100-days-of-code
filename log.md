# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Finished watching [Traversy Media's ExpressJS Crash] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnsO8-xJ8rs) on Youtube. I am using MySQL instead of MongoDB from the video. I made a database and was able to connect to it using NodeJS/ExpressJS. Started reading ExpressJS Guide.   

**Thoughts:** In school, we used PHP, Slim framework, and Propel ORM for the Internet programming class. Now, I am learning NodeJS and ExpressJS. I am slowly learning and learning something new is hard but also exciting. My next step is to be able to do basic CRUD functions. Probably for this week, I will only study node and express. After that, I can work on a project.
