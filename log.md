# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0a: January 1, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Finished watching [Traversy Media's ExpressJS Crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnsO8-xJ8rs) on Youtube. I am using MySQL instead of MongoDB from the video. I made a database and was able to connect to it using NodeJS/ExpressJS. Started reading ExpressJS Guide.   

**Thoughts:** In school, we used PHP, Slim framework, and Propel ORM for the Internet programming class. Now, I am learning NodeJS and ExpressJS. I am slowly learning and learning something new is hard but also exciting. My next step is to be able to do basic CRUD functions. Probably for this week, I will only study node and express. After that, I can work on a project.

### Day 0b: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to retrieve data from the database and also add data into the database using raw SQL and nodejs. I used this [tutorial](https://dev.to/achowba/build-a-simple-app-using-node-js-and-mysql-19me) as a reference. I watched about [SQL injection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciNHn38EyRc).

**Thoughts:**:Today was slow. I learned about SQL injection and I need to learn how to avoid it. Tomorrow, I will do editing and deleting data. I learned how to organize my files also.

### Day 0c: January 3-4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to update and delete data from the database. 

**Thoughts:**: Finally done learning basic CRUD! Yesterday, the 3rd, I only fixed the add part and started to implemented update. I thought that it wasn't enough to log that in here so I combined yesterday and today's work.  Today, I finished update and delete! Tomorrow, I will do new Traversy Media's new tutorial and learn more! :)

### Day 0d: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Started [Traversy Media's Node.js With Passport Authentication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FOq4cUdH8k) and learned updated way to code using nodejs and express. I was doing an example from his 2 yeard old ExpressJS Crash Course video so it was nice to learn a better way to code.

**Thoughts:** I am just gonna log what I did today but I will continue working on it. When I am done with this practice, I will officially start working on my project... hopefully tomorrow!
